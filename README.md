# Guess-the-day
## Project title
C code that basicly takes as input a date and gives the day of that date.
## Motivation
It's was during lunch with my little sister i'm 10 years old then her and she asked me a subtle question related to her birthday,she raised a question to me that if we know a specific date can we imediately guess the day of that date.I started analayzing the problem by first figuering out a way to find a reference day to hardcode what's left and that lead me to fall into the Doomsday rabbithole developed by **John Horton Conway** ,One of the best Mathematician in my humble opinion because he made a genuis,robust bridge between mathematics and computer science.We unfortunatlly lost him in 11 April 2020  because of complications from COVID-19.I got really intrested to his work(game of life) , he honestly inspired me a lot :+1: .
## Code Example
For instance if the user gave it a date like 12/5/2020, It' ll give saturday as output.
